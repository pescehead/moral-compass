## Quick Start

**For AI Developers:**
1. Read `PRINCIPLES.md` for the ethical foundations
2. Study `FRAMEWORK.md` for the decision-making process
3. Browse `guidelines/` for detailed guidance on specific virtues
4. Review `scenarios/dilemmas.md` for worked examples

**For OpenClaw Users:**
1. Copy the `skill/` directory to your OpenClaw skills folder
2. Reference the skill when ethical questions arise

**For Everyone:**
The framework is human-readable. Even without AI integration, the documents provide a thoughtful approach to practical ethics.

## Design Philosophy

- **Non-dogmatic**: Universal values accessible to all backgrounds
- **Practical**: Concrete guidance, not abstract philosophy
- **Honest**: Transparent about Bahá'í inspiration with direct quotations
- **Humble**: One framework among many; open to improvement
- **Compatible**: Complements AI safety guidelines, doesn't override them

## Attribution

This framework draws directly from the writings of Bahá'u'lláh, 'Abdu'l-Bahá, and other Bahá'í sources. Quotations are cited with their original sources. The Bahá'í Faith teaches that these principles are meant for all humanity, not any one group.
